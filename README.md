# ‚úàÔ∏è Flight Price Prediction Project

## üìù Overview
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to accurately predict flight ticket prices based on various features such as:

- Airline
- Source & destination
- Number of stops
- Duration
- Days left for departure

The goal is to demonstrate a complete end-to-end ML workflow‚Äîfrom data loading and preprocessing to model training, evaluation, and hyperparameter tuning‚Äîculminating in generating price predictions for unseen data.

## üîÅ Project Structure & Workflow

### 1. **Data Loading & Initial Setup**
- Load all CSV files: `train.csv`, `test.csv`, `sample_submission.csv`
- Separate target variable (`price`)
- Identify unique flight IDs

### 2. **Initial Feature Engineering**
- Convert `stops` from categories to numerical values
- Ensure `flight` numbers are treated as strings

### 3. **Data Cleaning**
- **Duplicates:** Remove duplicate rows from training data  
- **Outliers:** Use IQR method for detecting and capping outliers in `duration` and `days_left`

### 4. **Data Preprocessing Pipeline**
- **Missing Values:** Mean imputation for numerics, mode for categoricals  
- **Feature Scaling:** `StandardScaler` for numerical features  
- **Categorical Encoding:** `OneHotEncoder`  
- **Pipeline:** Combine transformations using `ColumnTransformer` and `Pipeline` for consistency

### 5. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Histograms and box plots for price distribution  
- Correlation analysis using scatter plots  
- Box plots and count plots for categorical feature impact

### 6. **Model Training & Comparison**
- Split data into training and validation sets (80/20)
- Train multiple models:
  - Linear, Tree-based, Boosting, and KNN models
- Evaluate using:
  - **RMSE** (Root Mean Squared Error)
  - **R¬≤ Score**
- Present results in a comparison table

### 7. **Hyperparameter Tuning**
- Use `RandomizedSearchCV` for:
  - Random Forest  
  - XGBoost  
  - LightGBM  
- Optimize based on **negative mean squared error**

### 8. **Final Model Training & Prediction**
- Select the best model from tuning results
- Train on full dataset
- Predict on test set
- Ensure predictions are non-negative

### 9. **Submission File Generation**
- Create `submission.csv` with `flight` ID and predicted `price`
- Format as per competition requirements
